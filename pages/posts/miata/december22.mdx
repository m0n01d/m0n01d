# The Miata is working

I’ve been hard at work on the miata in between work and social engagements. I can’t believe how far its come and we’re really close to being on the road.



First [I cleaned the engine bay](https://youtu.be/8QESJYwBymw) to make the upcoming work easier and cleaner. It’ll also help catch future leaks. 



I spent some time [just looking over](https://youtu.be/LJrnqvV89ME) the car and torquing things down 

Years ago, I did a clutch job on the NB right before buying a new car, and practically parking the NB. So I just wanted to make sure some things were torqued and in spec.

I need a hardtop for racing, and for fun, so I ordered [a lightweight racing hardtop ![hardtop](/images/miata/hardtopthumb.jpg)](https://youtu.be/o2bXcvIbBYA) from treasure coast, and picked it up from CCP.




It’s hard to find a good video of removing [a broken valve cover bolt from your miata so I decided to make such a video.](https://youtu.be/X9p0sRsnOV4)

I also replaced all the valve cover bolts with RSpeed bolts.

To date my longest and hardest job has been [the timing belt and water pump kit also from TCM. ![engine](/images/miata/engine.JPG)](https://youtu.be/dELHfl4f3l4) 

The NB even got new coolant hoses, and a Koyorad radiator.
I did some extra quality of life improvements while I was in there. 
I decided to install an oil drain valve, since im racing and doing more oil changes. As well as resealed some oil lines and things. This little project has been full of ups and downs. But it pays to be patient.


I can’t believe how far the car’s come in the last couple months.
It feels good to scoot around with the top down. I miss having the wind in my hair and the sun on my face. 

What’s next for the NB?
I need tires before I can really daily it again. It still has the tires I bought it with 6 years ago. It needed tires back then. 
I picked up another set of NA wheels, so that later this year I can buy snow tires for racing.

I’m still debating getting a rollbar. I need to double check the rules and see if it’s required. Im 80% sure its not, but it still would be a nice to have.

There’s still some other little projects I have to do too. 

New lights, and light bar. I opted for a steering wheel cover over an aftermarket for now. I really need to install the push-to-start button too. 
The list goes on. But damn it feels good. I feel like I’m doing all the work I should have done the last 6 years, crammed into 3 months. 

It feels incredible to be making progress. Filming and editing is a lot of work sometimes. But its nice to be able to look back and have a record of the progress. 

Lets go!
