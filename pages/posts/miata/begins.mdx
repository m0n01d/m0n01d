# Miata therapy

Ive given it a lot of thought and in a way this car kinda represents my struggle with depression.

Years ago, I used to work on this car a lot and it brought me a lot of joy.

I could lose hours in the garage underneath it. 

Bones aching. Fingers numbed.

It was challenging and fun.
<br/>

But then things changed.
<br />

Bolts shear.

Tires rot.

Metal grinds.

Miles add up.

Things fade away.

<br/>



One day im gonna fix it up

One day im gonna race it

One day 

For years. 

Knowing deep down the thought of working on it was completely unappealing and draining.


Pushing it out of the way rather than deal with some issues.


Just burying it in the garage with other junk.
Or half abandoned in a backyard. Ignored and neglected.

Prioritizing other things.

<br/>

Now we’re finally getting closer to that day.


I’ve ordered a lot of parts to give the Miata a refresh. 

and I picked up a bunch of expensive tools.
<br/>

I just ordered a whole set of replacement belts and hoses.

Along with new valve cover bolts.

And a lightweight racing hardtop.

That's just the start.

<br />
A lots changed the last year and I want to reward myself.

I’ve worked extremely hard the last several years.

Spending all my money on a racecar sounds like something I can enjoy.

I feel like I finally have a direction 	to move in again.

<br />

I finally feel like I can work on it again. 

I'm incredibly exicited.
<br/>

I have a lot planned for this car. 

I want to build the rallycross car of my dreams.
<br/>

Parts are on their way.
